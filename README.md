# Compound Components in Angular

This repo contains the source code of my [Angular Vienna meetup session](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Angular-Vienna/events/248673721/) which can be [watched here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxQ8RnvLFPc).  
The corresponding slides can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/duffleit/compound-components-in-angular).
  
The project is based on Angular 6 and was created with the angular cli.  
Feel free to run it locally with `npm install && npm run start` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see it in action.
